## 🏷️ Also Known As

This plugin goes by several names that describe the same concept:
- **Folder Tag Sync** (official name)
- **Dynamic Tags & Folders**
- **Tag and Folder Mapper**
- **Polyhierarchy Plugin** (conceptual nickname)

All refer to this same plugin for **bidirectional folder-tag synchronization**.

---

## 🚧 Development Status

This plugin is currently in **active development** (v0.1.0 beta). Core features are working, with advanced features in progress.

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

**Full Transparency**: Most of this plugin's code was written by AI (Claude Code) with me deeply involved in testing, design decisions, and quality control. I'm not a seasoned web or Obsidian plugin developer—my background is primarily Python and tabular data work.

**What this means:**
- ✅ Rapid development with comprehensive testing
- ✅ Well-documented, modern codebase
- ✅ 156+ automated tests
- ⚠️ Ongoing learning curve for traditional plugin patterns
- 💡 Committed to maintenance and user feedback

## ✨ Features

### Current (v0.1.0)
- ✅ **Folder → Tag Sync** - Automatically add tags based on folder location
- ✅ **Tag → Folder Sync** - Move files to folders based on tags
- ✅ **Regex Pattern Matching** - Flexible folder/tag matching

## 🎯 Why This Plugin?

### The Problem
- **Folders** are rigid, single-hierarchy structures required for file storage
- **Tags** are flexible, overlapping hierarchies better for knowledge representation
- Managing both manually is tedious and error-prone

### The Solution
Intelligent, rule-based bidirectional mapping that:
- Keeps your folder structure organized for specific audiences
- Maintains a flexible tag system for knowledge connections
- Automatically synchronizes both views based on rules you define

### Unlike Other Plugins
Unlike simple file movers (like Auto Note Mover), this plugin uses:
- **Regex patterns** instead of exact string matching
- **Transformation templates** to handle naming convention changes
- **Bidirectional sync** to maintain both folder and tag views
- **Priority system** for conflict resolution

## 🚀 Installation

### Method 1: Manual Installation (Current)

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cybersader/obsidian-folder-tag-sync/releases)
2. Extract to `.obsidian/plugins/folder-tag-sync/` in your vault
3. Reload Obsidian
4. Enable "Folder Tag Sync" in Settings → Community Plugins

### Method 2: BRAT (Beta Testing)

Install via the [BRAT plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat):
1. Install BRAT from community plugins
2. Open BRAT settings
3. Add `cybersader/obsidian-folder-tag-sync`
4. Enable "Folder Tag Sync"

### Method 3: Community Plugins (Coming Soon)

Once approved, install directly from Obsidian's community plugins browser.

## 🎬 Quick Start

### 1. Open Plugin Settings

Go to **Settings → Folder Tag Sync**

### 2. Create Your First Rule

Click **"Add Rule"** and configure:

**Example: Projects Folder**
```
Rule Name: Projects Folder
Direction: Bidirectional

Folder Pattern: ^📁 01 - Projects/(.*)
Folder Entry Point: 📁 01 - Projects

Tag Pattern: ^01-projects/
Tag Entry Point: 01-projects

Transformations:
  - Strip emojis from tags
  - Convert to snake_case
  - Keep number prefixes
```

**Result:**
- File in `📁 01 - Projects/Web Dev/` → Gets tag `#01-projects/web_dev`
- File with tag `#01-projects/mobile_app` → Moves to `📁 01 - Projects/Mobile App/`

### 3. Test Your Rule

Use the **"Test & Preview"** section to see how patterns transform.

### 4. Sync Manually

Use command palette commands:
- **"Folder Tag Sync: Sync folder to tags"** - Updates tags based on current folder
- **"Folder Tag Sync: Sync tags to folder"** - Moves file based on tags

## 📖 Documentation

### Core Concepts

#### Rule Directions
- **Folder → Tag**: File location determines tags (read-only tag generation)
- **Tag → Folder**: Tags determine file location (moves files)
- **Bidirectional**: Both directions active

#### Transformation Pipeline
Folder paths and tags can be transformed through a pipeline:
1. **Emoji Handling** - Strip or keep Unicode emojis
2. **Number Prefixes** - Handle Johnny Decimal format (01, 02, etc.)
3. **Case Transform** - Convert between naming conventions
4. **Regex Transform** - Custom pattern replacements
5. **Character Cleaning** - Remove invalid tag characters

#### Priority System
Rules are evaluated in order (top to bottom). First matching rule wins.
- Drag rules to reorder priority
- Higher rules = higher priority

### Example Configurations

<details>
<summary><b>Example 1: PARA Method</b></summary>

```json
{
  "name": "Projects",
  "folderPattern": "^Projects/(.*)",
  "tagPattern": "^projects/",
  "direction": "bidirectional",
  "tagTransforms": {
    "caseTransform": "kebab-case"
  }
}
```

**Result:**
- `Projects/Active/My Project` ↔ `#projects/active/my-project`

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Example 2: Zettelkasten Inbox</b></summary>

```json
{
  "name": "Inbox",
  "folderPattern": "^Inbox$",
  "tagPattern": "^inbox$",
  "direction": "bidirectional",
  "folderEntryPoint": "Inbox",
  "tagEntryPoint": "inbox"
}
```

**Result:**
- Files in `Inbox/` ↔ Tag `#inbox`

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Example 3: Entity-Based Organization</b></summary>

```json
{
  "name": "User Projects",
  "folderPattern": "^👤 Alice/📁 Projects/(.*)",
  "tagPattern": "^--alice/projects/",
  "direction": "bidirectional",
  "folderEntryPoint": "👤 Alice",
  "tagEntryPoint": "--alice",
  "tagTransforms": {
    "caseTransform": "snake_case",
    "emojiHandling": "strip"
  }
}
```

**Result:**
- `👤 Alice/📁 Projects/Research` ↔ `#--alice/projects/research`

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Data Flow
```
File Event → Rule Matcher → Transformation Pipeline → Sync Executor
     ↓             ↓                    ↓                    ↓
  Created     Finds match      Converts naming       Updates tags
  Moved       by priority      conventions           or moves file

### Transformation Example
```
Input: "📁 01 - My Cool Project"
  ↓ Strip Emoji
"01 - My Cool Project"
  ↓ Strip Number Prefix
"My Cool Project"
  ↓ snake_case
"my_cool_project"
  ↓ Tag Entry Point
"#projects/my_cool_project"
```

### Tech Stack
